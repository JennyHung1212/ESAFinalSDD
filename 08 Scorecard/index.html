	<p style="padding: 0 100px; text-align: justify;">From our initial interviews with the target audience, we found that a game that had high playability, a high degree of fun and a wide variety of content was preferred by them when choosing a game to play. High playability is important to ensure the game is easy to play, catering to a larger audience. A high degree of fun is necessary as successful conveying of game content is dependent on how much players enjoy the game playing process; psychology research has shown that emotional engagement better aids in encoding information in our memory. Having a wide variety of content is also important as it helps to provide players with a broad understanding of Singapore.
		<br><br>
	We hence decided that these should be attributes that we “grade” our various concepts against, in order to come up with a game that best meets the preferences of our target audience. In addition, we added the attribute of visual attractiveness as we believe it is important in holding the attention of players throughout the game, and helps to retain information more effectively. 
<br><br>
	After we had decided on these attributes, we ran a survey asking our target audience to select the attribute we felt was most important. From there, we counted the number of votes each attribute had and were able to rank them as follows (in decreasing order of importance): degree of fun, quality and variety of content, visual attractiveness, playability.<br><br>
	While there was no formal method in which we assigned the weights (mostly because the differences in rank percentages were not very large), we tried our best to reflect the rankings, and gave values based on what we felt were important to us too.
