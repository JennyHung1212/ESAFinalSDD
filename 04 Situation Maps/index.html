	<P style="padding: 10px 100px; margin: 30px 0; text-align: justify">Our objective is to cultivate interest in, and provide knowledge about Singapore to people around the world. We have identified three main qualities the game should have so as to better achieve our objective: fun elements, awareness and education, and ease of visualisation. The increase of these three components will increase our success.
	<br><br>
	To include elements of fun, a good sense of humour is needed. The phrases and words that we use should be able to entertain the target audiences and increase their excitement about the game. A competitive element is also desirable for increasing the level of fun the game brings as it better engages the target audience and motivates them to “play harder” through providing them with a goal to work towards. It also allows them to end with a greater sense of achievement. Further, varying levels of difficulty enable players of different skill levels to be actively engaged in the game. 
<br><br>
	To increase the awareness and education component of our game, we need to have both high content quality and variety. The quality of the content would be high if we are able to correctly identify content that would be most relevant to our target audience. For example, the topic of food in Singapore would be relevant as our target audience as that is often of great interest when one travels to another place, and is also a necessity when traveling. A greater variety of content would enable us to touch on a larger range of Singapore-related topics, such as landmarks, culture, food, laws and lifestyle. Moreover, the game should have sufficient information such that every time it is played, players can increase and build on their knowledge.
<br><br>
	To be able to capture the the interest of target audiences towards our game, ease of visualisation is important. This is because appropriate usage of graphic images alongside words would allow players to more easily form a mental image of what Singapore is like. With a pictorial representation, they would more effectively retain the information.
<br><br>
	To achieve all the above elements, we proposed an educational game about Singapore.
