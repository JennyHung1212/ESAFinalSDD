			 Players start to run out of the playing cards they have on hand one by one (Player 4, then Player 1, then Player 2, then Player 3), though this does not necessarily happen in order of play. When they run out of cards they just get skipped over while the other players continue to play cards, if they have any. Eventually it reaches a point where all players run out of playing cards, and thatâ€™s when the game ends.
