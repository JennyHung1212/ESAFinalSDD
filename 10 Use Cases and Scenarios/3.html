			 A player (Player 3) randomly receives a challenge penalty card in the penalty stage, as he/ she was the last to complete an action in the playing stage. The player reads the challenge posed on the penalty card and manages to complete it successfully. The player is then able to choose one player to pass it to (Player 1). The penalty stage ends when the penalty card has been kept by a player.
