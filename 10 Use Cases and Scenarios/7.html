			 A local playing card/ a match in two object playing cards has appeared (in this case, the object playing card), and players all respond by executing the corresponding action. However, two players execute the action, at the same time, last. In such a situation, the local playing card/ both object playing cards are set aside. The next time a local playing card/ a match in two object playing card appears, all players have to execute the action corresponding to the new appearance, followed by that of the card(s) set aside. The last person to execute the action will then be penalized in the penalty stage.
