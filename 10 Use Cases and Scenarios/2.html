			 Players randomly flip open the same object playing cards consecutively (Player 1 flips open an object playing card, then Player 2 flips open the same object playing card) and players respond to the match. Players try to execute the corresponding action as fast as possible, but ultimately one player (Player 3) ends up doing it last. The player then gets penalized.
