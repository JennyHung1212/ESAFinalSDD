			 A penalized player (Player 4) needs to draw a penalty card, but the penalty cards have all run out although players still have playing cards onhand. The penalty cards each player has is thus to be recorded down, then all the penalty cards collected and reshuffled by a player (Player 3 in this case). The penalized player then draws a penalty card from the newly shuffled pile.
