		<P style="padding: 10px 100px; margin: 30px 0; text-align: justify">
			 A penalized player (Player 4) needs to draw a penalty card, but the penalty cards have all run out although players still have playing cards onhand. The penalty cards each player has is thus to be recorded down, then all the penalty cards collected and reshuffled by a player (Player 3 in this case). The penalized player then draws a penalty card from the newly shuffled pile.

			 The penalty stage has just started. Player 4 is due to receive a penalty card because he/ she was the last to complete an action in the playing stage. However, there are no more penalty cards.
