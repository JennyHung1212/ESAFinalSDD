		 The aim of the game is to accumulate as little penalty cards as possible. 
<br><br>
The game alternates between two stages - the playing stage (using playing cards) and the penalty stage (using penalty cards). <br><br>

Playing cards are first dealt out to all players, but players do not get to look at their cards. Starting in the playing stage and going in a round, each player takes turns to flip open a card from the playing cards they have been dealt. Every time a particular (set of) card(s) is (are) placed down (consecutively), players have to execute the action corresponding to the card(s). The last player to execute the action will then have to draw a penalty card; the game enters the penalty stage.<br><br>

After the penalty card has been drawn, the penalized player is to follow the instructions on the card. If the player clears the challenge posed by the penalty card, if any, he/ she gets to pass the card to a player of his/ her choice. Otherwise, the player keep it. The game then goes back to the playing stage once a penalty card has been kept by a player. This cycle repeats and the game ends when all playing cards have been played.
